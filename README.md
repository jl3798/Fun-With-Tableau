## Data Analysis
# This is an analysis of the CitiBike data collected in New York. As shown is "Dashboard 2", we see that a majority of CitiBike users do not identify as 'male' or 'female' which is a new occurence with the acceptance of different genders since 2020. Dashboard 1 does not have any unique trends or patterns as most bikes are returned to the same area they were checked out from. However, we are not tracking each bike individually so it is very difficult to tell where each bike's start and return point are. The longest average trip time that stands out is '30 minutes' which has only occured once for people who are 28 years old. After that point we can see the trip duration consistently decline until age 30. This shows that 28-years olds are the most active group when it comes to utilizing the bikes.
